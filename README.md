<!-- Richard Rigaud Personal Blog website submission 

title:  Reggae Post Blog
A container using grid layout & Flex box 
images imported using <img> src tag as well as url() within CSS

I broke apart the css into parts to better manage the flow of things . imported to base.css

The design is original.
I struggle with a responsive layout 
I believe a mobile design should have been executed first 
no matter how many tutorials I have watched, the concepts min-width max-width are hard to grasp.


THANKS .  please review  -->
